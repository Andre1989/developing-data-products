## Interface to simulate the trajectory of a projectile neglecting air resistance  ##

Interface to simulate the trajectory of a projectile neglecting air resistance. 
The physical concepts describing the movement can be viewed in the pitch presentation, which can be accessed here:

**Instructions**:

1. The user sets the initial parameters in the input boxes located on the left:
  - Initial launching position
  - Initial launching height
  - Initial projectile velocity
  - Launching angle
  
2. The trajectory of the projectile is displayed in a plot as a gray line. Three points are also displayed:
  - Initial position
  - Maximum height
  - Landing position
  
3. Some parameters related with the projectile motion are also displayed below the plot:
  - Maximum height reached by the projectile 
  - Time to reach the maximum height
  - Total flying time
  - Distance run by the projectile 
  - Final displacement from the initial position
  - Optimal launching angle for maximum displacement
